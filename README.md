## A Quarto Website with a Health Economics Twang to Host learnable and teachable R code

A quarto website I am working on to help other health economists learn R.

I have paid for the solyates.uk domain and registered training.solyates.uk subdomain and tied it to this quarto website in order to have a training site that is (fairly) easibly reachable.
