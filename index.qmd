```{r}
1 + 1
```

This is an example of the code used to make the following ggplot:
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)",
    y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species",
    shape = "Species"
  )
```
Notice the `color`, `shape` arguments and `geom_smooth()` function used in the included code block!
