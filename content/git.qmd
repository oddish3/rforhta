title: "git and github"
---

git is a difficult but extremely helpful tool for those of us that work with data.

git is a tool that tracks changes to your files and enables you to share those changes with others. 

These git configured set of files are called repositories or repos and are organised in a structured way.

A rather large caveat is that:

1. it is very much not advised to store data in these projects on git
2. when working in groups, it is best to store data elsewhere and have scripts that interact with your local copy of the data

In my work, i use git to store text based code as a backup in case i make breaking changes to my analytical workflow that result in different results / different subsets of data etc.
