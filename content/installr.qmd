title: "Install R/Rstudio"

[slides from the workshop](../meta/R_Workshop.pdf)

This will (hopefully) walk you through installing R (the language) and Rstudio (the language editor) to do some Rstats!
This is similar to writing some English (the language) in Microsoft Word (the language editor).

## Installing R

- [Rstudio Installation docs](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

After navigating to this website, the download and install R will link you to R installation

![CRAN](../meta/download.png)

Next we want to get to the following page and download whichever R version for your system.

![InstallR](../meta/installr.png)

Once you have completed the setup and open R, you should see a window similar to this:

![RConsole](../meta/Rconsole.png)

This is the graphical user interface for the R language, as opposed to Rstudio, which is much more user-friendly.

Alternatively here is a video to walk you through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HzKf-StvOE)

## Installing Rstudio

RStudio is the editor with which we interact with the R language.

- [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Congratulations, you have installed R and Rstudio and taken your first steps to reproducible research in R.

### First time opening Rstudio


![Rstudio](../meta/rstudiowindow.png)

- There is likely a lot to take in right now, and a lot of the text you see infornt of you is currently irrelevant
- However, the tall red section on the left is the Console and that's where you can type in R code to execute. This code is also called commands or functions.

![Rstudio](../meta/rstudiopanes.png)

- In the top right section, there's the Environment tab where you can see the data you are currently working on. At first this section is empty because you have not loaded any data yet.
- In the bottom right section there are tabs to flip through the Files and folder structure of your computer (like in Finder or Explorer), Help information etc.

## What everything means in Rstudio

In order to get the following top script editor in your top left pane, you want to use Ctrl/Cmd + N to create a new file. 
Alternatively, navigate to file > new file
Or, use the folling button in the top left of Rstudio window and select new R file

## Getting started with R

In order to get started, lets talk through:

- creating an R script to run some R code
- create a project for your code

### Setting your working directory

If you want to read or write files on your computer from and to a specific location you will need to set a working directory in R. To set the working directory in R to a specific folder on your computer you will use the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# On a windows pc, you would set the working directory like this
setwd("C:/Documents/MyR_Project")

# On a mac, you would set the working directory like this
setwd("~/documents/MyR_Project")
```

Or, using the top dropdown menu
![Rstudio](../meta/setwd.png)

Or using the 'More' gear symbol from the bottom right pane
![Rstudio](../meta/setwd1.png)

## Project orientated Workflow

However, you should always start a fresh project (File | New Project…) that will automatically set up your working directory without having to point to it in your script file. 

Navigate to the R project button in the top right:
![Rstudio](../meta/proj1.png)

When you press this, you will get the following options:
![Rstudio](../meta/proj2.png)

Selecting new project, you are greeted with the following options:
![Rstudio](../meta/proj3.png)

Selecting New project and New directory:
![Rstudio](../meta/proj4.png)

You are now asked to create a project (and folder name) as part of a directory you choose in the second box
![Rstudio](../meta/proj5.png)

Congratulations! If you can see the file project name in the top right project button and bottom right file path (next to the home symbol), you have taken you first steps to reproducible research in R!

## R packages

"In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package."
— Hadley Wickham, R packages

R packages are collections of functions code, data sets, documentation and tests developed by the community, that are mostly made available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN, the public clearing house for R packages.

These packages are developed by experts in their fields and currently the CRAN package repository features over 14,000 of them. Many of the analyses that they offer are not even available in any of the standard data analysis software packages, which is one of the reasons that R is so successful.

### Installing R packages

You will likely see something like this in your Rstudio bottom right pane
![Rstudio](../meta/pckg.png)

This means that currently the MASS package is installed, to get this on your system you will need to press the install button and type in this package in the box that pops up

![Rstudio](../meta/install.png)
